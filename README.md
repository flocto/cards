# Cards
This is a small site created to play card games of any type (and even with custom rules).

Still a work-in-progress.

# Current Goal
Move deployment from Vercel as they do not support socket.io :/

NextJS APIs are treated as serverless functions, currently
looking to move to Heroku. 

# Checklist
- [x] Seperate client and server
- [x] Individual card rendering
- [ ] Individual hands/decks rendering
- [ ] "Rooms" to host and play games
- [ ] User accounts/customization
- [ ] Advanced game logic
